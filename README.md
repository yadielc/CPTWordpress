<strong>Custom Post Types and Taxonomies on WordPress Project</strong>

This project contains code made by me as part of the course I took on Lynda.com. The
name of the course is "WordPress: Custom Post and Taxonomies" by Morten Rand-Hendriksen.

On this project you will find:

1. posttypes.php - a basic plugin used to create the custom post types.
